main class is separate and has Run
TheoryMatcher class has the JPanel of anything

either
1. TheoryMatcher is not runnable
it returns its own Jpanel in a method and Main wraps that in a JFrame and displays it

2. TheoryMatcher is runnable
Main does something along the lines of 
			PackageSelector writerGui = new PackageSelector();
			writerGui.initializeGui();
			Thread writerThread = new Thread(writerGui, "writer thread");
			writerThread.start();
			
Smelly...
Main -> ReadScalesAndChords.readIn -> retrieveGroup -> Group.setNotes -> Group.setUpAllModes
