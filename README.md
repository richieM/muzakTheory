muzakTheory
===========


Muzak Theory is a Java program designed to help you learn music theory by relating commonly used scales and chords.

The program allows you to "cross-check" various scales and chords and tells you what chords you can play with what scales.  Its been really helpful for me in learning new scales and chords on guitar.
