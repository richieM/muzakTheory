Here's some basic music theory to make sense of the program:

A scales is an ordered set of musical notes that are designed to be played in various sequences.  
A chord is a set of notes (usually 3 or more) designed to be played simultaneously.

Western music theory is dodecaphonic - meaning there are 12 notes in an octave. 
C, C#, D, Eb, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, Bb, B makes 12, and then back to C to complete the octave. 
This is why there are 12 notes on a piano before the key pattern repeats.

When I'm playing, I like to think of my root or home note as 0,
so when playing in the key of C, then C is my 0 note, or "root note".

So if C = 0 (my root note), then counting up half steps (a half step is just going up or down by one note)...

C  = 0
C# = 1
D = 2
Eb = 3
E = 4
F = 5
F# = 6
G = 7
G# = 8
A = 9
Bb = 10
B = 11
C = 12 = 0 = octave 

(Because there are 12 unique notes, you can think of Western dodecaphonic music as being modulus 12.)

Let's define a Major Scale to have the notes {0,2,4,5,7,9,11}.  
The numbers here represent the half-steps from the root note. 

By this logic, a Major Scale in the key of C will be {C,D,E,F,G,A,B}. C is the 0 note, or root note, here.  
It's also completely arbitrary, but in this case I chose C = 0.  
Because the C Major Chord is defined to have the notes {0,4,7}, or {C,E,G},  
then you can play C Major Chord with C Major Scale because they share the same notes,{0,4,7} or {C,E,G} 
-- depending on how you look at it.

Now imagine that you like the sound of the Minor Chord (which is {0,3,7}), 
and you're wondering where to play it in the C Major Scale.  How can we do that?

At this point we introduce the musical concept of modes.  
Modes are effectively just looking at the same scale in a different way by shifting the root note. 
So the Dorian (2nd) mode of the C Major Scale will start on the 2nd note of the C Major Scale (which is D), 
and use the same notes.  
 
If we start on D and use the same notes, we get {D,E,F,G,A,B,C}. 
It is the same group of notes, but now D is the 0 or root note.  
This group of notes can be written as as {0,2,3,5,7,9,10} when D = 0. 
Notice how we talking about the same group of notes as before, but we shifted our home-note. 
We are still talking about the same 7 notes C/D/E/F/G/A/B but we're looking at it differently through a shift.
 
Now, we discover that the Minor Chord is {0,3,7} and the Dorian (2nd mode) {0,2,3,5,7,9,10} both share the same notes {0,3,7}, 
which means we can play the D Minor Chord in the C Major Scale!!

When you run the program, on the left is a selectable list of scales, and on the right is a selectable list of chords.  
Select as many of each that you'd like, the the Scale/Chord relationships will be calculated for you.
